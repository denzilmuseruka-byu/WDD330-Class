	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<h4>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 9</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
			information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
		<li>Remember that JavaScript can be run in different environments. The BOM only makes sense in a browser
			environment. This means that other environments (such as Node.js) probably won’t have a <code>window</code>
			object, although they will still have a global object; for example, Node.js has an object called
			<code>global</code>.</li>
		<li>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is
			the <code>window</code> object. This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the
			<code>window</code> object.</li>
		<li>The <code>window</code> object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the
			<code>Navigator</code> object. The <code>Navigator</code> object contains information about the browser
			being used. Its <code>userAgent</code> property will return information about the browser and operating
			system being used.</li>
		<li>The <code>window.location</code> property is an object that contains information about the URL of the
			current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the
			URL.</li>
		<li>The <code>window.screen</code> object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. You
			can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using the <code>height</code> and
			<code>width</code> properties respectively.</li>
		<li>The <code>availHeight</code> and <code>availWidth</code> can be used to find the height and width of the
			screen, excluding any operating system menus.</li>
		<li>Each <code>window</code> object contains a <code>document</code> object. This object has properties and
			methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
		<li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way
			of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a browser does not remember anything from
			one request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered.
			Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between
			requests.</li>
		<li>The <code>window.setTimeout()</code> method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a
			number of milliseconds as its second parameter.</li>
		<li>The <code>window.setInterval()</code> method works in a similar way to <code>window.setTimeout()</code>,
			except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
		<li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but
			has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for
			storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used
			during future sessions.</li>
		<li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to
			find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.
			This information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of
			travel.</li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>
	<h4>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 14</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The <code>data-</code> attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are
			ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external
			service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</li>
	</ul>
